                        Sketch or line art colorization is a research field with significant
                        market demand. Different from photo colorization which strongly relies on texture
                        information, sketch colorization is more challenging as sketches may not
                        have texture. Even worse, color, texture, and gradient have to be generated
                        from the abstract sketch lines. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic
                        learning-based framework to colorize sketches with proper color, texture as
                        well as gradient. Our framework consists of two stages. In the first drafting
                        stage, our model guesses color regions and splashes a rich variety of colors
                        over the sketch to obtain a color draft. In the second refinement stage, it
                        detects the unnatural colors and artifacts, and try to fix and refine the result.
                        Comparing to existing approaches, this two-stage design effectively divides
                        the complex colorization task into two simpler and goal-clearer subtasks.
                        This eases the learning and raises the quality of colorization. Our model
                        resolves the artifacts such as water-color blurring, color distortion, and dull
                        textures.
            
            
                        We build an interactive software based on our model for evaluation. Users
                        can iteratively edit and refine the colorization. We evaluate our learning
                        model and the interactive system through an extensive user
                        study. Statistics shows that our method outperforms the state-of-art
                        techniques and industrial applications in several aspects including, the visual
                        quality, the ability of user control, user experience, and other metrics.
